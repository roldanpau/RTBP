0. ABSTRACT

  - Word 'primaries' has not been introduced.

  - "Asteroid belt" -> "Asteroid belt located between the orbits of Mars and
    Jupiter.

  - We don't mention that this is the ELLIPTIC rtbp. I think that the word
    'elliptic' should appear in the abstract.

1. INTRODUCTION

AFTER CONJECTURE 1.2:

  - After mentioning the work of Moeckel, Bolotin and McKay, maybe we could
    add the sentence: "Also, Delshams, Gidea and Rold\'an have shown an
instability mechanism in the spatial restricted three-body problem, but only
locally around the equilibrium point $L_1$; see [DGR11]." 
The reference [DGR11] should be added: 
[DGR11]: A. Delshams, M. Gidea, and P. Rold\'an. Arnold's mechanism of
diffusion in the spatial circular Restricted Three-Body Problem: A
semi-numerical argument. Preprint, 2010.
http://www.ma1.upc.edu/~roldan/normalhyper2.pdf

  - "but our strategy allows us TO keep these computations to the simplest"

1.1.1. THE ASTEROID BELT

  - "We also omit interactions WITH the second biggest planet"

  - "This implies that the strength of interaction with Saturn IS around 10%"

1.1.2. KIRKWOOD GAPS

  - "The mean motion resonanceS"

  - "Then, the Kirkwood gaps correspond" -> "The Kirkwood gaps correspond"

1.2. THE ELLIPTIC PLANAR RTBP

  - As it is now, the main result is buried inside section 1.2 The elliptic
    planar rtbp. I would introduce an independent subsection called "Main
result" between subsections 1.2 and 1.3, to make it more visible. 

1.3.3. SPEED OF DIFFUSION

  - "In Appendix D we discuss THE relation"

  - Footnote 1: "This does not seem crucial as for real values e_0 should not
    be smaller than \mu" -> "This does not seem crucial, since the real value
of e_0 is not smaller than \mu".

1.3.4. ON NEKHOROSHEV'S STABILITY

  - Several 'the' are missing: "THE estimate", "THE semi-major axis", "THE
    constant".

  - "involved into the proof" -> "involved in the proof"

1.4 MECHANISMS OF INSTABILITY

  - "One of the most natural resonances in the elliptic problem (even a
    three-body problem) ARE the mean motion orbital resonances."

  - Through the paper, sometimes we use the words "osculating ellipse", and
    sometimes "instant ellipse". This may be confusing, we should just use
one expression.

  - "In Figure 3 we consider the plane (a,e), which describeS the ellipse of
    the Asteroid".

1.6 NATURE OF NUMERICS

  - The second point is somewhat confusing. I would change it to:

  "We show that for all J\in[J_-,J_+] we have two intersections of W^s(p_J)
and W^u(p_J). Each intersection is transversal for almost all values of J,
but it becomes tangent at an exceptional (discrete) set of J's.
Nevertheless, we check that at least one of the two intersections is
transversal for each J\in[J_-,J_+]. See figure~\ref{fig:splittings}."

  - The last paragraph is too involved. I would write:

  "As seen in the Appendixes A,C, the numerical values that we deal with are
several orders of magnitude larger than the estimated error of our
computations, and therefore these computations are reliable. Moreover, all
the computations that we handle are standard and low-dimensional."

3. THE CIRCULAR PROBLEM
3.1 INVARIANT CYLINDER

- On Theorem 3, it says "for certain constant C>0". This words should be
  removed.

A. NUMERICAL STUDY OF THE HYPERBOLIC CYLINDER OF THE CIRCULAR PROBLEM

- Second paragraph:
  "which would require Computer-Assisted techniques like interval
arithmetics" -> "which would require Computer-Assisted techniques as in
[WZ03]", 

and include the following reference in the bibliography:

@article {WZ03,
    AUTHOR = {Wilczak, Daniel and Zgliczynski, Piotr},
     TITLE = {Heteroclinic connections between periodic orbits in planar
              restricted circular three-body problem---a computer assisted

}

- Also on the second paragraph: 

  "There is a whole range of possible numerical computations which one could
think of to prove our result." -> 
  "One could think of several possible numerical computations to prove our
result."

  "In addition to the fact that this computation would not bring much light
on the mechanism of instability, it would cast formidable issues of numerical
analysis" ->
  "This computation would not bring much light to the mechanism of
instability, and moreover it would involve formidable numerical analysis
problems"

  "At the opposite" -> "On the contrary"

A.1 COMPUTATION OF THE PERIODIC ORBITS

  - "We look for a resonant periodic orbit $\lambda_J$" -> "We look for a
    resonant periodic orbit $\lambda_{J_0}$"

  - After Remark A.1:
  "Since in the region of the phase space we are dealing with $\partial_{p_y}
J \neq 0$" -> 
  "Since $\partial_{p_y} J \neq 0$ in the region of the phase space we deal
with"

  - "(see the GSL manual for details)" -> 
    "(see the GSL manual~\cite{GSL} for details"

and then include the reference in the bibliography:

@book {GSL,
    AUTHOR = {Galassi, M. et al},
     TITLE = {GNU Scientific Library Reference Manual},
      ISBN = {0954612078},
}

  - Figure 5 (caption): 
  "Resonant periodic orbit $\gamma_{-1.6}$" ->
  "Resonant periodic orbit $\lambda_{-1.6}$"

  - I am including an improved version of Figure 6 in the attached file
"porbits.eps". Please replace the old file "porbits.eps" with this new one, and then include the figure in the latex file with the following code:

\begin{figure}
\psfrag{H}{$H$}
\psfrag{T}{$T_H - 14\pi$}
\psfrag{T2XXXXXXX}{$T_H - 14\pi$}
\psfrag{L2XXXXXXX}{$L_{\max}$}
\includegraphics{figs/porbits}
\caption{Resonant family of periodic orbits.
We show normalized period $T_H - 14\pi$, and maximum deviation of $L$
component with respect to the resonant value $7^{1/3}$ (see
equation~\eqref{eq:Ldeviation}).}
\label{fig:porbits}
\end{figure}

  - Remove the sentence "(Since $DP^6(p)$ is a $2 \times 2$ matrix, the
eigenvalues are trivial to compute.)", because this comment is trivial.

- I am including an improved version of Figure 7 in the attached file
  "hypers.eps". Please replace the old file with this new one, and then
include the figure in the latex file with the following code:

\begin{figure}
\psfrag{H}{$J$}
\psfrag{lu}{$\ln(\lambda)$}
\includegraphics{figs/hypers}
\caption{Characteristic exponent $\ln(\lambda)$ as a function of
energy level $J$ (the other exponent is $-\ln(\lambda)$).}
\label{fig:hypers}
\end{figure}

  - I am including an improved version of Figure 8 in the attached file
    "trtbp_porbits.eps". Please replace the old file with this new one.

  - "which is stated in Theorem 3" -> "which is the second bound given in
    Theorem 3"

A.2 COMPUTATION OF INVARIANT MANIFOLDS 
--------------------------------------

- First sentence: "In this appendix, we compute" -> "In this Appendix we
  compute"

- Figure 8 (caption):
  "on the section $\Sigma$" -> "on the section $\Sigma^+$"

- First sentence: "In this appendix, we compute" -> "In this Appendix we
  compute"

- I am including an improved version of Figure 15 in the attached file

A.4 Accuracy of computations
----------------------------

- "In Table 2 we tabulate the $x$ coordinate of $W^{u,1}(p_3)$ and $W^{s,1}(p_2)$ on these axis". The last word should be "axes", not "axis".

B The resonance in Delaunay coordinates
---------------------------------------

- "IT is much more convenient to use them to study the mean motion resonance"

- "intersect the section $y=0$ six times whereas THEY intersect $g=0$ seven
  times"

- Sometimes we use the words "the section g=0", and sometimes "the section
  {g=0}". We should just use one expression.

- "intersect the section $y=0$ six times whereas they intersect $g=0$ seven
  times." ->
  "intersect the section $y=0$ six times whereas they intersect $g=0$ seven
times. However, we remark that the homoclinic points $z_1$ and $z_2$ lie on
the symmetry axis both in Cartesian and in Delaunay variables. See
Figures~\ref{fig:invmfld2_H174} and~\ref{fig:orbitpdel_H174}."

The figures are attached (see files invmfld2_H174.eps and orbitpdel_H174.eps).

Then include the figures in the latex document using the following code:

"Thus we consider $I\in[I_-,I_+]=[-J_+,-J_-]$, where the range $[J_-,J_+]$
is given in (92)."

- Second paragraph: 
"on the corresponding energy level of energy" -> 
"on the corresponding level of energy"
