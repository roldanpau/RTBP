This is a library of functions for different computations related to the Restricted Three Body Problem, or RTBP for short. The software is available upon request (just email me), so that I can keep track of who's using it and why.

This software has been developed for my own research, in particular for the following paper: \char`\"{}Diffusion along mean motion resonance in the restricted planar three-\/body
  problem\char`\"{} by J.Fejoz, M.Guardia, V.Kaloshin and P.Roldan. (\href{http://arxiv.org/abs/1109.2892}{\tt link})

The kind of functions that you will find here are
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Numerical integration of the RTBP equations (in Cartesian variables)
\item Numerical integration of the RTBP equations (in Delaunay variables)
\item Cartesian to Delaunay change of coordinates
\item Numerical integration of the RTBP variational equations
\item Poincare section and associated Poincare map (in Cartesian)
\item Poincare section and associated Poincare map (in Delaunay)
\item Numerical computation of (some family of) periodic orbits
\item Hyperbolic splitting (eigenvalues/vects) associated to a fixed point of the Poincare map
\item Numerical computation of hyperbolic invariant manifolds associated to fixed point
\item Homoclinic intersection of invariant manifolds
\item Numerical computation of splitting angle of the manifolds at the homoclinic intersection

A big thanks goes to Angel Jorba for altruistically sharing his ideas about RTBP computations with me. Moreover, he provided me with the high-\/precision Taylor method integrator which is at the base of some of my computations.
